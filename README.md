# successful-playlist
using Spotify data to answer: what defines a successful playlist

# Motivation
What makes a successful playlist?

# Steps
I am making this up as I go along. My tentative game-plan is as follows:
1. Explore dataset - see if I can create broader content categories
2. Define a criteria for a "successful" playlist - want to get away from broadly popular ranked definitions
3. Prelimiary model predicting a model's "success"
