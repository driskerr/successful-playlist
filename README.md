# Successful Playlist
# Motivation
What makes a successful playlist?

# Files 
- Spotify Playlists EDA.ipynb > code
- Spotify - Driscoll.pdf > final presentation
- playlist_factor_loadings.xlsx > exploratory factor analysis naming exercise

# Steps
I am making this up as I go along. My tentative game-plan is as follows:
1. Explore dataset - see if I can create broader content categories
2. Define a criteria for a "successful" playlist - want to get away from broadly popular ranked definitions
3. Preliminary model predicting a model's "success"
