# Successful Playlist
# Motivation
What makes a successful playlist?

# Files 
- **code**: Spotify Playlists EDA.ipynb
- **final presentation**: Spotify - Driscoll.pdf
- **supplement** (exploratory factor analysis naming exercise): playlist_factor_loadings.xlsx

# Steps
My game-plan:
1. Explore dataset - see if I can create broader content categories
2. Define a criteria for a "successful" playlist - want to get away from broadly popular ranked definitions
3. Preliminary model predicting a model's "success"

# Contributors
Me, myself and I.
